Revision history for ElasticSearch::SearchBuilder

        2013-04-20
        Support for score_type in has_child/has_parent added


0.18    2012-11-25
        BREAKING CHANGE:
        The and/or/not logic in queries was being merged incorrectly into
        single bool queries with top-level "must" and "should" clauses,
        which changed the logic slightly, eg:
        A && B && (C||D) was interpreted as A && BB && (C || D || 1)

        Changed to using Test::Deep to fix the test errors caused by the
        change in hash randomization in perl 5.17.6

0.17    2012-11-09
        Minor correction - _top_recurse on an empty clause should return
        undef, not an empty list, as it is called in scalar context

0.16    2012-10-31

        BREAKING CHANGE:
        The 'text' queries have been renamed 'match' queries in
        elasticsearch 0.19.9.

        Added 'indices' filter
        Added 'match' multi-field query

        certain clauses. Now makes copies

        Added 'fuzzy_rewrite', 'fuzzy_max_expansions', 'lenient',
              'quote_analyzer','quote_field_prefix' to -qs and -field

        Added -custom_boost
        Added the 'type' parameter to geo_bounding_box
        Added 'minimum_number_should_match' to query_strings
        -type now correctly supports multiple types
        Switched from Module::Build to EUMM
